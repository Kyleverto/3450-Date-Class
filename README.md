## Project Description
This is a Date class that makes use of different types of constructors, static members and methods, as well as unit tests. The class holds a date and it's methods can change that date or give you information about it.

## Exceptional Parts
I feel like I did a really good job making the class very simple and compact. I don't have a lot of experience working with constructors, and I feel like I did a good job with them in this.
